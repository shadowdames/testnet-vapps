## Project
### Name & Category
- **Project**: TaskChain
- **Category**: productivity

### Description
TaskChain is a decentralized task management platform that enables secure, transparent, and incentivized task collaboration. It solves the problem of centralized task management tools lacking trust and accountability by leveraging blockchain for immutable task records and Soundness Layer (SL) for scalable, secure data processing. Users can create, assign, and track tasks, with rewards distributed via smart contracts for completed work.

### SL Integration  
TaskChain uses Soundness Layer for scalable transaction processing and data integrity. Specific SL features include:
**zk-SNARKs**: For private task verification, ensuring sensitive task details remain confidential.
**State Channels**: For off-chain task updates, reducing latency and costs.
**SL Smart Contracts**: For automated reward distribution upon task completion.

## Technical
### Architecture
TaskChain employs a modular architecture with a React-based frontend, a Rust backend for smart contract logic, and SL for blockchain interactions. Task data is stored on IPFS for decentralization, with metadata pinned to SL for fast access. Smart contracts handle task creation, assignment, and reward distribution.
### Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust (for SL smart contracts), Node.js (API server)  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer, Ethereum (for token rewards)
- **Storage**: IPFS, SL metadata storage

### Features
1. Decentralized task creation and assignment with role-based access control
2. Automated reward distribution via SL smart contracts for completed tasks.  
3. Private task management using zk-SNARKs for sensitive projects.

## Timeline
### PoC (3 weeks)
- [ ] Basic task creation and assignment functionality
- [ ] SL smart contract integration for task logging
- [ ] Minimal React-based UI for task management
### MVP (6 weeks)  
- [ ] Full task management features (create, assign, track, complete)
- [ ] Production-ready SL integration with zk-SNARKs and state channels
- [ ] User testing with beta testers from Discord community

## Innovation
TaskChain is unique due to its integration of SLâ€™s scalable blockchain features with a user-friendly task management interface. Unlike traditional tools like Trello or Asana, TaskChain ensures transparency, immutability, and incentivization through blockchain, making it ideal for remote teams, DAOs, and freelance networks. Its privacy features via zk-SNARKs allow secure collaboration on sensitive projects, a feature absent in most competitors.
